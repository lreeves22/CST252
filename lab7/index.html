	<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>Worked with my partner to write functions that take user input. </p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Learning the functions stuff is hard. I had some things spelled
		 incorrectly in my code so that didn't help with the frustration.
		 Had a rough time linking my JavaScript code to my main page and
 		getting everything else to work as well.</p>

		<p>Happy to say I figured out the code and spelled the things correctly for
		it to appear with the correct name thing on my page. </p>
