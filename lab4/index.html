		<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
		<h1>Challenege</h1>
		<p>In this lab we created lists of different tasks that we would later turn
		into comments in JavaScript. </p>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
		<p>Some problems I had were trying to configure my CSS. It just took awhile to
		space everything. Also listing the list in numbered order. I had to go
	find the code for a list. </p>

		<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>I'm proud of my progress. I feel that I am finally understanding how
		coding works. Not that great but I'm glad I just don't feel as lost. </p>
